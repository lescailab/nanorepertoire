## Introduction

**nf-core/nanorepertoire** is a bioinformatics pipeline that enables the analysis and characterization of nanobody repertoires from NGS data.
It identifies expanded nanobody clusters potentially involved in antigen binding and immune response, and generates a detailed, reproducible report on the repertoire features of antibodies and nanobodies.

The pipeline is built using [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io), a workflow tool to run tasks across multiple compute infrastructures in a very portable manner. It uses Docker/Singularity containers making installation trivial and results highly reproducible. The [Nextflow DSL2](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/index.html) implementation of this pipeline uses one container per process which makes it much easier to maintain and update software dependencies. Where possible, these processes have been submitted to and installed from [nf-core/modules](https://github.com/nf-core/modules) in order to make them available to all nf-core pipelines, and to everyone within the Nextflow community!

## Functionality Overview

A graphical view of the pipeline can be seen below

## Usage

> [!NOTE]
> If you are new to Nextflow and nf-core, please refer to [this page](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/installation) on how to set-up Nextflow. Make sure to [test your setup](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/introduction#how-to-run-a-pipeline) with `-profile test` before running the workflow on actual data.

### Input samplesheet

To run the pipeline, you need to prepare a CSV file containing metadata and paths to your input FASTQ files.
The samplesheet must contain the following columns:

````csv
sample,fastq_1,fastq_2,individual,boost,immunisation

Each row represents a pair of FASTQ files (paired-end) associated with a given biological sample and metadata.
Here's an example:

sample,fastq_1,fastq_2,individual,boost,immunisation
sample_01,sample_1.fastq.gz,sample_2.fastq.gz,ind1,1,unenriched
sample_02,sample1_1.fastq.gz,sample2_2.fastq.gz,ind2,2,RBD_enriched

#### Column descriptions:

- **sample**: Unique identifier for the sample.
- **fastq_1**: Path or URL to the first read (R1) FASTQ file (paired-end).
- **fastq_2**: Path or URL to the second read (R2) FASTQ file (paired-end).
- **individual**: Identifier for the biological individual or subject.
- **boost**: Boost number (e.g. 1 for priming, 2 for first boost, etc.).
- **immunisation**: Type of immunisation or enrichment strategy (e.g. `unenriched`, `RBD_enriched`, etc.).


Make sure all paths are accessible (local or remote) and the CSV is comma-separated (not tab-separated).




Now, you can run the pipeline using:


```bash
nextflow run nf-core/nanorepertoire \
   -profile <docker/singularity/.../institute> \
   --input samplesheet.csv \
   --outdir <OUTDIR>
````

> [!WARNING]
> Please provide pipeline parameters via the CLI or Nextflow `-params-file` option. Custom config files including those provided by the `-c` Nextflow option can be used to provide any configuration _**except for parameters**_; see [docs](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/getting_started/configuration#custom-configuration-files).

For more details and further functionality, please refer to the [usage documentation](https://nf-co.re/nanorepertoire/usage) and the [parameter documentation](https://nf-co.re/nanorepertoire/parameters).
